Ruth Asawa was born in 1926 in Norwalk, California, a small agricultural town in Los Angeles County. She was the fourth of seven children. The Asawa family worked in sugar beets and leased a “truck farm” in Norwalk until 1942 when President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 authorizing the internment of nearly 120,000 people of Japanese descent.[^1] Growing plants, raising kids, Alvarado Workshop, SOTA, and work ethic.

Asawa earned praise for drawing at a young age, and continued drawing during internment under the mentorship of professional artists. Black Mountain College influenced her whole approach to making art. She studied at BMC for three years, from 1946 to 1948, working closely with Joseph Albers and Buckminster Fuller. Their mentorship led Asawa to experiment with galvanized wire as an artistic medium. She initially learned how to crochet with wire from basket makers in Toluca, Mexico while on a summer break from Black Mountain in 1947. Traditionally the baskets were used to sell eggs and produce in street markets. Inspired by Albers and Fuller, Asawa began working with the material in a more abstract way, as a line that could interlock, interweave, and “go anywhere” in space—such that she could draw and sculpt simultaneously. With her abstractions in wire, by the end of the decade, Asawa had established a signature style and become the first Asian American woman to earn recognition in the male-dominated field of postwar modern sculpture.

In a letter to Albert Lanier written by Asawa in the late 40s, she wrote: “I no longer identify myself as a Japanese or American, but a ‘citizen of the universe.’” However, she did eventually circle back to work on public commissions like the Japanese-American Internment Memorial (1994) in downtown San Jose.
